                        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 28, 2018</p>

                        <p>Deciphered from ancient tablets carbon-dated back to around the fall of the Roman Empire, 
                            the C Programming Language was initially conceived as a means to calculate and maintain grain stores.</p>

                        <p>Really though, C in an imperative programming language developed in Bell Laboratories 
                            (so named for the guy who invented the phones and stuff) from 1969 to 1973. 
                            Many languages today are either descended from C, such as C++, C# and Objective-C, or based on C syntax, such as Java,
                            JavaScript and Perl. This is what’s known as a Legacy. Or, rather: the benefits of being really, really old.</p>

                        <p>Before we get to C, let’s get in to a bit of Ancient History: </p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp; <b>The Predecessor of C, Or Rather, The Aptly Named B</b></p>

                        <p>B was developed by Ken Thompson, the original writer of the great granddaddy
                            of all operating systems: UNIX. Thompson developed B, which had its own roots in ALGOL 60 
                            (the 60 means it came out in 1960!), so that he could use it to rewrite his precious baby OS in a new lingo.
                            At the time, UNIX was written in Assembly and was an absolute nightmare to use and maintain. 
                            Worse still, it only ran on their DEC PDP-7 computer, with a whopping 8K words of memory. 
                            However, if you consider the price tag of $454,242 it was relatively efficient for its price point.</p>

                        <p>B was considered to adhere to the ‘Worse Is Better’ software paradigm. This ‘It Tastes So Awful 
                            It Has to Be Good for You’ solution states that software which has less functionality but is easier to use
                            may actually be more desirable to the end user. Coding in Assembly had more power than B, but the tradeoff
                            was that B could be used by actual humans.</p> 

                        <p>Thompson’s pal Dennis Ritchie later joined the project. The team managed to convince the higher-ups that
                            they needed an upgrade for their half-million-dollar computer, and they were granted a PDP-11. 
                            At $120,000 it was an absolute steal. The team soon discovered their new UNIX operating system written in B
                            was not suited to the PDP-11. A huge letdown.</p>

                        <p>Rather than drag their PDP-7 (which would have weighed several hundred kilograms) out of storage, 
                            they decided to heavily rework B. Improving on their formula with their new language NB (New B), they produced
                            excellent results. The dynamic duo eventually settled on the name of C, because New B just sounds kind of weak.</p>

                        <p>C is a compiled language, as opposed to B, which was an interpreted language. Because of this, C had the ability to be
                            deployed onto many platforms. Thompson and Ritchie had laid the foundation for one of the most significant developments
                            of modern programming:</p>

                        <p><b>&emsp;&emsp;Cross-Platform Portability!</b></p>

                        <p>One of the greatest strengths of C at the time was its ability to function on just about any computing system. 
                            As compilers for other computing platforms were developed, C code could be compiled and executed on those platforms 
                            with ease. Today, a variety of C compilers exist for every imaginable platform, making it one of the most widely used 
                            languages in the world, even after 46 years! Few platforms exist that do not have a C compiler. 
                            All because Thompson and Ritchie didn’t want to use their PDP-7 anymore. This brings us to the next topic:</p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>You Keep Using That Word...</b></p>

                        <p>What even is a Compiler?</p>

                        <p>In the strictest sense, a compiler is a special type of program that converts statements from one programming language 
                            into another language. Compilers for different languages behave differently, and can produce different output. 
                            The Java compiler – javac – takes in Java statements and converts them to bytecode. Bytecode is a special type of code 
                            that can be interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, which converts the bytecode to actual machine code which can be 
                            executed by the CPU.</p>

                        <p>C compilers, on the other hand, take a more direct approach. The C compiler will take statements written in C and 
                            convert them explicitly to machine code, which can be directly executed by the CPU. C compilers for a specific 
                            platform create machine code specifically for that platform. This presents a huge advantage in the performance of
                            C compared to other high-level languages such as Java. Java bytecode has to work its way through a runtime environment
                            (the JVM, in this case) before it ever gets to the CPU as machine code. And it pours through the JVM about as fast as cold molasses.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>A Lesson in Abstraction</b></p>

                        <p>Java is considered a high-level language because it is by many orders abstracted from the base-level machine code. 
                            Abstractions are a fundamental concept in programming, because they are so useful to humans. Of course, performance would be great
                            for programs written entirely in machine code, but these programs would be extremely tedious to produce.</p>

                        <p>Abstracting away the fine details of these machine instructions to produce human readable statements is incredibly helpful. 
                            Each applied abstraction can reduce away detail. However, as many abstractions are layered upon each other, such as the transition 
                            from Java Code > Java Compiler > Bytecode > JVM > Machine Code, performance tends to degrade. C language has relatively few abstractions,
                            and is considered ‘Close to The Metal’. The long and short of it? C is fast.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Oh My God It’s Everywhere</b></p>

                        <p>Among its speed and efficiency, C sports features like Direct Memory Access which allow it to function capably as an operating system.
                            Since compiled C code doesn’t need any fancy runtime environments or even an operating system to function 
                            (and it can run on bloody anything), C itself can form the backbone of any OS. In fact, nearly every device in our daily lives is
                            in some ways powered by C. Devices using...</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>&emsp;Linux</p>
                        <p>C forms the bulk of Linux – The Best Operating System – which is unsurprising because Linux is closely based on UNIX.
                            Linux is considered a ‘UNIX-Like’ system.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>&emsp;Mac OS X</p>
                        <p>Mac OS has a majority of its components built in C. The Mac OS kernel, called Darwin -  which is closely related to BSD 
                            (Berkley Software Distribution, another UNIX variant) - is almost entirely written in C with a smattering of Assembly tossed in.
                            Although, over time many parts of Mac OS have been developed in Objective-C, a distant descendant, as well as the more recent Swift.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>&emsp;Windows</p>
                        <p>Windows has its kernel written mostly in C, though a large portion of the system is also in C++, along with C#. But nobody likes Windows anyway.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>&emsp;iOS</p>
                        <p>Having its roots in the Mac OS X operating system, the iOS kernel is written in C.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>&emsp;Android</p>
                        <p>A heavily modified version of Linux, the Android kernel bares a striking resemblance to its Linux relative, again almost entirely in C.</p>	
                        <br/>

                        <p>The most popular and widely used database software, such as Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are coded almost entirely in C,
                            with an added helping of C++ thrown in for good measure.</p>

                        <p>And lastly, the multitude of embedded systems, TVs, radios, appliances. All C. All the time.</p>

                        <p><i>The Too-Long, Didn’t Read?</i></p>

                        <p>C is the Betty White of languages. Flexible, fast, efficient, and used everywhere. And it’s still got a lot of life left to live.</p>
